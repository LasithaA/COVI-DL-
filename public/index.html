						<h1>Covid Detection App</h1>

						<h3>What is [name of app]</h3>
						<p>
							[name of app] is for users to find out their chances of surviving
							if they get Covid-19 (with % accuracy) based on their current
							pre-existing medical conditions. They can also find out whether or
							not they have Covid-19 (with % accuracy) based on their
							chest-xray.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The app uses an image of the patient's X-Ray to classify the user
							into one of 3 categories: Covid-19, Pneumonia, or Healthy the
							image. Trained and deployed using Google Cloud AutoML with 94%
							precision. The Survival Chance part of the app uses the patient's
							medical information to predict how likely they are to recover from
							Covid-19. Trained using a regression neural network model with 81%
							precision.
						</p>
						<br />
						<br />
						<p class="asterisk">
							** Model is created from data gathered from Mexico and is
							reflective of their population's circumstances
